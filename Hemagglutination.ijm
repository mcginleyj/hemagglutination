// WellDist is the distance in pixels determined by drawing a horizontal line from the left inner edge of a center 
// well to the right inner edge of the same well. KnownDist is the known value well diameter in mm according to
// the manufacturer spec sheet. 
// Note: These values must be determined by each user as camera height, image resolution and type of 96 well plate used will vary.
// RecWidth and RecHeight are pixel values used to draw a small rectangle in the center of the plate image
// that is resized by the user to the edges of the plate prior to cropping the image. 
// MaxThresh is the maximum image threshold value in a 255 grayscale range with black=0 and white=255. 
// Note: if a well is automatically excluded due to excessive artifact try editing the MaxThresh value.
